## GDD314FinalProject-MouthyBird
## What is this
This is an Instagram/Facebook filter that mimics the iconic Flappy Bird game, but instead uses how open your mouth is to move the bird up and down the screen to pass through pipes.

## How to run
If downloaded from GitHub, double click the flappyBird.arproj file and it should open up in Meta Spark Studio (if installed).

If you would like to try it out without downloading, the filter can be found on my Instagram page @jacobhogrefe.
